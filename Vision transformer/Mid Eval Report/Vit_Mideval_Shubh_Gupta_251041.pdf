Assignements solved:-
Assignment 1 - 
In this assignment we took a datasample and Learned about applying Numpy and Pandas Creating functions and Which was finally used to find the expected scores and predicted scores.
Also using matplot Plotting the Results.

Assignment 2 -
In this assignment We imported the MNIST dataset and done backpropagation, Updating variables Writing the code for model and at the end Also calculating the accuracy which came out to be approx 85.45%
Basically this model can see handwritten numbers from 0 to 9 and can Tell which number is it.

Assignment 3- 
	In this assignment Only theoretical questions were there.

Assignment 4-
           In this assignment we defined the baseline model It was about CNN and batch 
           normalization Where we also calculated the accuracy, training and validation loss &       
           Accuracy. The graph plotted was very close to the actual training datasets.

Assignment 5-
In this assignment we made a character level language model where names of dinosaurs were taken and then randomly new names were generated by observing the pattern.
